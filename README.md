# Simple Image Recognition App

This project demonstrates a minimal web application that performs image
classification using a pre-trained model. Upload an image from the web
interface to see the predicted label and confidence.

## Files
- `1.txt` - placeholder file.
- `server.py` - Flask backend providing the prediction API.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.
- `templates/index.html` - Web interface for uploading images.

## Running
Install dependencies and start the server:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
